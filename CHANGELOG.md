## [Unreleased]

## [v1.3.1] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Server delivery SBOM: scan a server's layers separately (OS rootfs and application) and combine them with `--merge`, which merges several CycloneDX SBOMs into one; the web UI accepts a rootfs directory as input. (#161)

### Changed

- GHCR package names are unified under the `bomlens` brand; `sbom-generator` and `sbom-scanner` remain aliases of the same digest. (#156)
- The Android image pull defaults to the published `bomlens` name. (#157, #158)
- Documentation is restructured by intent with English as the canonical language, sidebar labels shortened, and the landing pages use the web UI demo gif. (#154, #155, #160)

### Fixed

- Source scans no longer leak `src@latest` as the root component name, which became a non-unique Black Duck codelocation and blocked unrelated imports. The caller's project name is now passed to cdxgen and stamped into the root component, and the pipeline fails closed if stamping does not take. (#166)
- `--merge` preserves each input's dependency graph so the merged BOM stays CycloneDX-conformant. (#164)
- Follow-ups from the v1.3.0 verification pass (V13-1/2/3). (#159)
- Corrected the first-scan link in the Korean server-delivery guide and modeled static linking as a blind spot rather than a separate layer. (#162, #163)

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- `--trusca <project_id>` (or `--upload-target trusca`) uploads the generated SBOM to TRUSCA's native ingest endpoint as an alternative to the default Dependency-Track upload. (#148, #149)
- Vulnerability rows in the web UI expand in place to show the CVSS score and vector, the full advisory description, and reference links — surfacing data already in the Trivy report without an extra fetch.
- The components table in the web UI can now sort by name, version, or type and filter by component type and license, alongside the existing search.
- The vulnerabilities table can be filtered by severity, and the summary tab shows a license distribution (component count per license, plus unlicensed).
- The dependency graph is now interactive: click a node to see its details (version, type, licenses, direct/indirect), and search to highlight matching packages.
- Documentation site: a Release notes link in the nav (pointing at GitHub Releases) and opt-in, cookieless analytics (GoatCounter) that stays off until a site code is configured.

### Changed

- Unified the web UI's empty, loading, and error states into shared primitives so every result view looks and behaves the same, and added a retry action to the dependency and source-tree views.

### Fixed

- Dependency graph node labels were unreadable in dark mode (fixed dark text on a dark canvas); graph colors now follow the light/dark theme tokens.
- Small dependency graphs no longer over-zoom into huge, overlapping labels; zoom is capped and node spacing widened so a handful of nodes stays readable.

## [v1.2.2] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- BomLens brand identity: aperture logo, app icons, and favicon across the docs site, web UI, and desktop app. (#125, #127, #128, #130)
- Rendered documentation site (sktelecom.github.io/sbom-tools) with sidebar navigation, search, and a one-click Windows download, replacing repo-only docs. (#112, #113, #114, #115, #116)
- New documentation pages on the site: use the Docker image directly, architecture, and the two contributing guides, each with an English translation. (#126)
- English translations for the five previously Korean-only guides. (#117)

### Changed

- Renamed the product display name to BomLens; technical identifiers and download URLs are unchanged. (#120)
- The web UI header shows the BomLens brand with an SBOM generator descriptor. (#124)
- The post-process image is co-published as `ghcr.io/sktelecom/bomlens`; `sbom-generator` and `sbom-scanner` remain aliases of the same digest. (#121, #122)
- Reworked the Korean guides for readability and kept the synced English pages aligned; wide architecture diagrams now stack vertically. (#123, #129)
- The docs home leads with a headline, a Get started primary button, and a product screenshot; the header brand links to the home page. (#131, #132)

### Fixed

- The desktop app startup screen background matches the web UI dark token. (#118)

## [v1.2.1] - 2026-06-12

### Security

- The web UI cleanup endpoint validates the provided token before removing staged uploads, and CI workflows run with least-privilege permissions. (#106)
- Pinned base image digests so the supply chain is verifiable (Scorecard pinned-dependencies). (#107)

### Fixed

- The NOTICE dedupes appended SPDX license texts and normalizes the Expat alias to MIT, so each license text appears once. (#108)
- The SBOM stamps `metadata.component` from the input project name and version instead of leaving it unset. (#108)
- Stabilized byte-stable SBOM output and coerced null components to empty arrays, preventing spurious diffs and parse failures. (#108)

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Web UI source scans (current directory, Git URL, ZIP upload) now resolve transitive dependencies through cdxgen language images, matching the CLI. The web UI previously used syft, which captured only directly declared dependencies; a Spring Boot sample went from 8 to 91 components. (#95)
- Scan results gained Components and Vulnerabilities tabs with searchable, sortable tables, next to the existing summary. (#96)
- Source scans now fetch dependency licenses (`FETCH_LICENSE`, on by default), so components and the NOTICE carry real license data instead of NOASSERTION. Set `FETCH_LICENSE=false` to skip the lookups. (#98)
- The NOTICE normalizes license aliases to SPDX ids, shows component copyright when present, and appends the SPDX standard full text of each used license from a bundled set (21 common licenses, offline). (#99)
- The security report surfaces CVSS, EPSS (exploit probability) and CISA KEV (known-exploited) signals, sorting findings KEV first, then by severity, then by EPSS. Set `SECURITY_ENRICH=false` for offline runs. (#100)
- Redesigned the post-scan artifact download experience with per-format chips and a bulk ZIP download. (#102)

### Changed

- Synced the user documentation, in-app help, and screenshots with the new features. (#101, #103)

### Fixed

- Removed the redundant maven pre-resolve step in build-prep that printed a spurious NoPluginFoundForPrefix error on every Java source scan, with no effect on the resulting SBOM. (#97)

## [v1.1.1] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Desktop startup screen is now bilingual: it follows the system locale (Korean on Korean systems, English elsewhere) and falls back to English, matching the web UI. The `SBOM_LANG` environment variable forces a language (`SBOM_LANG=en` or `ko`).

### Changed

- The main `README.md` is unified to English, with English UI screenshots. The Korean documentation table and Korean guides are kept for Korean users; the Korean screenshots stay with the Korean docs.

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Electron desktop app (`electron/`) that wraps the web UI with no console window: it checks Docker, pulls the scanner image, runs the `MODE=UI` container, and opens the UI on double-click.
- Desktop installers (`SBOM-Generator-*.exe` / `.dmg`) are built in CI and attached to tagged GitHub Releases, so non-developers can download them directly. Unsigned for now, so Windows SmartScreen prompts to confirm.
- License-manager quickstart (`docs/notice-quickstart.md`) and a setup-check helper (`scripts/check-setup.bat` / `scripts/check-setup.sh`) that reports Docker, image, and port status in Korean.
- Windows verification assets: an automated smoke test (`tests/windows-smoke.ps1`) and a manual e2e checklist (`tests/windows-e2e-checklist.md`).
- Desktop-app packaging study (`docs/internal/desktop-app-study.md`).
- Screenshots and a flow diagram across the user guides.
- Firmware analysis (FIRMWARE mode): unpack a firmware image and produce an SBOM and risk report.
- Supplier SBOM validation and analysis (ANALYZE mode) for SBOMs you receive from third parties.
- End-to-end support for five input forms (source folder, GitHub URL, ZIP archive, Docker image, binary/RootFS) with a risk report emitted in every mode.
- Local web UI: launch a scan, stream live logs, and download results from the browser.
- Cosign signing of generated artifacts via `--sign`, with the key and password passed into the container at runtime.
- Multi-architecture Docker images, with architecture detected at runtime for Trivy and cosign.
- Governance and community-health documents: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `SECURITY.md`.
- Korean documentation style guide, enforced by a doc-style check.

### Changed

- `scripts/sbom-ui.bat`: results go to a dedicated `%USERPROFILE%\sbom-output` folder, the scanner image is pre-pulled on first run with progress shown, and messages are in Korean.
- README routes first-time Windows users to the easiest path up front, and the license-manager quickstart leads with the desktop app and lists expected install and download times.
- Renamed the product to SBOM Generator; the post-process image is co-published as `ghcr.io/sktelecom/sbom-generator` (the legacy `sbom-scanner` name keeps working).
- Windows-friendly onboarding: a download-and-double-click web UI flow, plus consistent Windows guidance across the supplier docs.
- The Windows release archive now bundles both launchers and the host-mounted `build-prep.sh`, so it runs without the full repo.
- Reworked the scanner into a two-stage architecture (generate, then assess risk).
- Documentation refreshed to match the current product, including the web UI flow and the two core roles.

### Fixed

- Standard squashfs images now extract correctly during firmware unpacking.
- Detection of `.csproj`-only and `.gradle`-only projects (multi-glob matching bug).
- Generated artifacts are written as the host user so the Examples CI no longer fails on root-owned files.

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Initial public release of SBOM Tools.
- CycloneDX SBOM generation from source code for Java (Maven/Gradle), Python, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, Rust, Go, .NET, and C/C++.
- Open-source notice (고지문) and a Trivy-based security report alongside each SBOM.
- Docker image distribution via `ghcr.io/sktelecom/sbom-scanner`.
- GitHub Actions workflows for CI (ShellCheck, hadolint, integration and example tests), image publishing, and releases.

### Security

- No publicly known vulnerabilities have been reported or fixed in this project to date.
